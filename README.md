## **What are you eating?**

	    In a world that is becoming increasingly technologically savvy, machines 
	  like the checkout counter at the grocery store areseeming outdated. It is
	  time for grocery stores, one of the primary areas of the consumer market 
	  got with the times and identified products without having to key in the code
	  or scan a barcode. To accomplish this on a smaller scale, we want to build a
	  model that takes into consideration factors like colors, textures, size of 
	  grocery store products and run multiple classification models to be able to
	  predict a certain type of item such as a fruit or baked goods accurately and
	  efficiently. It is meant to demonstrate that this can be scaled to more
	  features, better models and more robust training. Since this will be
	  conducted on a small scale, we cannot base all of our conclusions on one 
	  demonstration. It is important to show that it can be repeated and achieved 
	  at a larger scale.This will not only help alleviate the long lines in the 
	  grocery store, it will save the supermarkets on manual labor, and ultimately 
	  clear confusion on the customer’s side on what products they’ve chosen, 
	  especially if customers are sight-impaired. This will increase efficiency 
	  and save time and money. Though this concept is currently being tested by 
	  Amazon, the technology is not scalable and there are very few grocery stores 
	  equipped to accommodate this technology. We intend to demonstrate that this 
	  technology can be widely used and not just developed by tech giants like 
	  Amazon. The data comes from the COCO dataset and we intend to perform 
	  classification on this data.
